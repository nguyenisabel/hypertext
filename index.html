<h2>Get to Know Isabel</h2>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Isabel Nguyen and my pronouns are she/her. Although this is my junior year of college, this is my first year at Western! I'm a psychology major with a minor in UX design. The world of computer science is quite new to me, so I am excited to see what this quarter brings in CSCI 202.

<h2>Isabel's Favorite Things</h2>
<p>
    When I have the free time, my favorite things to do are crochet, watch movies, and read books! Lots of my hobbies align with each other, since I am almost always crocheting while watching a movie or listening to music. Or listening to music while reading.
